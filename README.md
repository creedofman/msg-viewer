**Note:** This project is a fork. I am not the original creatorâ€”credit for the original code and idea goes to [molotochok/msg-viewer](https://github.com/molotochok/msg-viewer).  
I have made minor changes to remove all analytics and ensure there are no external calls whatsoever.  
No analytics, tracking, or external requests of any kind are present.
